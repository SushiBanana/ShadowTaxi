# ShadowTaxi

Welcome to **ShadowTaxi** - a fast-paced taxi simulation game in a world of endless roads. In this game, you are responsible for dropping passengers off at their destinations in one piece. Navigate oncoming traffic, fireballs and changing taxis when the vehicle is beyond salvageable. 

### Gameplay Highlights
- **Pick-up and Drop-Off**: Collect passengers and drop them off at their destination. Earn bonuses from passengers with higher priorities.
- **Dodge Obstacles**: Be careful of moving cars as they can inflict damage to your passenger, driver and taxi.
- **Collect stars for invincibility**: Afraid of potential damage? Fret-not! Collect as many stars to become invincible.
- **Dynamic weather conditions**: Choose passengers with no umbrellas when it's raining for bonus points.

### Victory!
Beat the target score of 500 in the shortest time possible!

### Game over
Watch out - the game ends when **any** of the conditions are fulfilled: 
- The timer runs out and the target score is not reached
- Your driver or any passenger dies
- The newly generated taxi escapes off-screen when you're not inside
